# API Design Assignment

## Project Name

*Replace with the name of your API project.*

## Objective

Design and develop a robust, well-documented API (REST or GraphQL) that allows users to retrieve and manage information from a dataset of your choice. The API must include JWT authentication, automated testing via Postman/Newman in a CI/CD pipeline, and be publicly deployed.

Choose a dataset (10000+ data points) that interests you — it should include at least one primary CRUD resource and two additional read-only resources. Sources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), public APIs, or CSV files work well. Pick something you find interesting, as you will reuse this API in the next assignment (WT dashboard).

*Describe your API in a few sentences: what dataset does it serve, what are its main resources, and what can users do with it?*

## Implementation Type

**GraphQL**

## Links and Testing

| | URL / File |
|---|---|
| **Production API** | *...* |
| **API Documentation** | *...* |
| **GraphQL Playground** (GraphQL only) | *...* |
| **Postman Collection** | `*.postman_collection.json` |
| **Production Environment** | `production.postman_environment.json` |

**Examiner can verify tests in one of the following ways:**

1. **CI/CD pipeline** — check the pipeline output in GitLab for test results.
2. **Run manually** — no setup needed:
   ```
   npx newman run <collection.json> -e production.postman_environment.json
   ```

## Dataset

*Describe the dataset you chose:*

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Dataset source** | [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset)|
| **Primary resource (CRUD)** | Tracks (track_id, track_name, artists, album_name, track_genre, duration_ms, popularity, key, explicit, tempo, danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness)|
| **Secondary resource 1 (read-only)** | Albums (album_id, album_name, total_tracks) |
| **Secondary resource 2 (read-only)** | Artists (artist_id, artist_name, genres, total_tracks, average_popularity) |


## Design Decisions

### Authentication

*Describe your JWT authentication solution. Why did you choose this approach? What alternatives exist, and what are their trade-offs?*

### API Design

**REST students:**
- *How did you implement HATEOAS? How does it improve API discoverability?*
- *How did you structure your resource URLs and use HTTP methods/status codes?*

**GraphQL students:**
- *How did you design your schema (types, queries, mutations)?*
- *How did you implement nested queries? How does the single-endpoint approach affect your design?*

### Error Handling

*How does your API handle errors? Describe the format and consistency of your error responses.*

## Core Technologies Used

*List the technologies you chose and briefly explain why:*


## Reflection

*What was hard? What did you learn? What would you do differently?*

## Acknowledgements

*Resources, attributions, or shoutouts.*

## Requirements

See [all requirements in Issues](../../issues/). Close issues as you implement them. Create additional issues for any custom functionality. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed testing requirements.
